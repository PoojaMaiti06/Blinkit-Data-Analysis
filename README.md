## Data Cleaning / Quality Check

Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in a dataset to improve its quality and usability.

## Column Quality

Column quality refers to the assessment of the validity, accuracy, and completeness of data within each column of a dataset. It helps identify errors, missing values, and inconsistencies that could impact the reliability of the analysis.

## Column Profile

A column profile is a summary of the key characteristics and distribution of data within a specific column of a dataset. It includes statistics such as the number of entries, distinct values, errors, and the frequency of each value, helping to understand the content and structure of the data in that column.

## Column Distribution

Column distribution refers to the breakdown of data within a specific column, showing the frequency and proportion of each unique value. It helps in understanding how different values are represented in the dataset, revealing patterns, trends, and outliers.

## Standardizing Data

Standardizing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing, ensuring consistency and improving the accuracy of analyses. In this context, standardizing involves replacing specific abbreviations or variations with a common term. 

### For instance, in the "Item Fat Content" column:
1. LF, low fat should be replaced with Low Fat to maintain uniformity in representing lowfat items.
2. Reg should be replaced with Regular to standardize the representation of regular-fat item.

## DAX Calculation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Microsoft Power BI to create custom calculations and perform advanced data analysis. It helps users build formulas and expressions to aggregate, filter, and analyse data efficiently. DAX is essential for creating complex measures and calculated columns in data models.

### Total Sales
DAX can sum up the revenue from all sales records. This involves creating a measure that aggregates the sales amount column in your dataset.
           
            Total Sales = SUM('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])

### Average Sales
DAX can find average up the revenue from all sales records. This involves creating a measure that aggregates the sales amount column in your dataset.

            Avg Sales = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])

### Number of Items 
DAX can count the distinct number of items sold. This involves creating a measure that counts the unique entries in the items column or table.

            No of Items = COUNTROWS('BlinkIT Grocery Data')

### Average Rating
DAX can compute the average customer rating by averaging the ratings across all sales records. This involves creating a measure that calculates the mean of the ratings column.

            Avg Rating = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Rating])

### Creating a New Metrix

            Metrix = {
               ("Total Sales", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Total Sales]), 0),
               ("Avg Sales", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Avg Sales]), 1),
               ("No of Items", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[No of Items]), 2),
               ("Avg Rating", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Avg Rating]), 3)
            }


## Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data, making complex information easier to understand and analyze. It transforms data into visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, enabling users to identify patterns, trends, and insights that may not be immediately apparent in raw data. Effective data visualization is crucial for decision-making, as it allows stakeholders to quickly grasp the significance of data and make informed decisions.

## Visualizations and Insights

### Total Sales by Fat Content

Regular fat items contribute more to total sales ($776.32K) than low-fat items ($425.36K), indicating higher customer preference for regular fat products.
